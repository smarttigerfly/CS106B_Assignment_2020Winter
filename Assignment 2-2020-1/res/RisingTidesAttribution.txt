The raw data for these samples comes from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's website:

    https://maps.ngdc.noaa.gov/viewers/wcs-client/
    
Some of the data were smoothed using a two-step grid refinement algorithm followed by a Gaussian blur.

We heard about this data source after reading Baker Franke's "Mountain Paths" Nifty assignment, available here:
