Perfect Numbers
---------------

Q1. How many numbers does the program search through? How many perfect numbers does it find? What are these perfect numbers?
A1: 40000；4；6、28、496、8128.

Q2. Record the timing results for `findPerfects` into a table.

    Line 122 Time findPerfects(20000) (size =  20000) completed in    0.907 secs
    Line 123 Time findPerfects(40000) (size =  40000) completed in    2.984 secs
    Line 124 Time findPerfects(80000) (size =  80000) completed in     11.4 secs

    Line 126 Time findPerfects(320000) (size = 320000) completed in  178.494 secs
    Line 127 Time findPerfects(640000) (size = 640000) completed in   712.26 secs

Q3. Does it take the same amount of effort to compute `isPerfect` on the number 10 as it does on the number 1000? Why or why not? Does it take the same amount of work for `findPerfects` to search the range of numbers from 1-1000 as it does to search the numbers from 1000-2000? Why or why not?
A3: TODO

Q4. Extrapolate from the data you gathered and make a prediction: how long will it take `findPerfects` to reach the fifth perfect number?
A4: TODO

Q5. Do any of the tests still pass even with this broken function? Why or why not?
A5: TODO

Q6. Can the test framework detect that the test case is "bogus", in the sense that the premise of the test case itself is off-base?
A6: TODO

Q7. Describe the testing strategy your used for your test cases to confirm `smarterSum` is working correctly.
A7: TODO

Q8. Record your timing results for `findPerfectsSmarter` into a table.

Q9. Make a prediction: how long will `findPerfectsSmarter` take to reach the fifth perfect number?
A9: TODO

Q10. Explain how you chose your specific test cases and why they lead you to be confident `findNthPerfectEuclid` is working correctly.
A10: TODO


Soundex
-------

Q11. What is the Soundex code for "Angelou"? What is the code for your own surname?
A11: TODO

Q12. Before writing any code, brainstorm your plan of attack and sketch how you might decompose the work into smaller tasks. Briefly describe your decomposition strategy.
A12: TODO

Q13. Think about one or more examples of a class of names that the Soundex system might not work well for. Explain what this class of names is and why the system might incorrectly group them or mis-categorize one of the names.
A13: TODO
